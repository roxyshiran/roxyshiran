# Roksana Shiran


I am a former professional basketball player and now in the final year of my PhD in Health Science at the University of Bern.

What drives me is the same passion I had on the basketball court: discipline, resilience, and teamwork. I bring these qualities into research, where I work with large, complex datasets, and into practice, where I apply Lean Six Sigma and Quality Control principles to improve systems and outcomes.

I am motivated by projects that create real impact ‚Äî turning evidence into action, improving processes, and building healthier communities. My long-term goal is to bridge my expertise in research, data, and quality with meaningful innovations that shape both health and industry.

As a retired athlete, I continue to embrace every season and journey ‚Äî whether summiting mountains or finding new challenges ‚Äî carrying with me the rich experiences that have shaped who I am today.
